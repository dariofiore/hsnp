# Homomorphic Signatures for NP relations


`hsnp` is a Rust library that implements *homomorphic signature schemes for NP relations* (HSNP).

**WARNING:** This is an academic prototype, and in particular has not received careful code review. This implementation is NOT ready for production use.

## Overview
The library currently implements:

1. The HSNP scheme `LHS` from [FT22] for Pedersen commitments to linear functions of signed data.
2. A partial version of the `SPHinx` HSNP scheme for R1CS from [FT22]. The current implementation includes all the building blocks of the generic HSNP construction in [FT22] except that it does not integrate yet `Marlin` zkSNARK.

## Build guide

To compile and execute `hsnp`, you should place `hsnp-poly-commit` (a fork of `ark_poly_commit` available [here](https://github.com/dariofiore/hsnp-poly-commit)) in a sibling directory.

To compile:

```
cargo build
```

To execute the benchmarks, first compile:

```
cargo bench --no-run
```
and then run:
``
./target/release/deps/hsnp_benches-filename HASH_PRECOMP BENCH FIRST LAST SIZE
``
where HASH_PRECOMP= {true|false} and BENCH = {var|hist|mlr|fixed}.
In the case of BENCH=hist SIZE is the size of an histogram bucket.
In the case of BENCH=fixed SIZE is the size of the fixed R1CS.

To execute with memory profiling and to write the timings in a file, run (on Linux):
``
/usr/bin/time -f "\n\nMax memory usage: %M KB." ./target/release/deps/hsnp_benches-filename HASH_PRECOMP BENCH FIRST LAST SIZE > outputfile
``
See [FT22] for more information about the benchmarks.
